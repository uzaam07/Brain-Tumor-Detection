# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection uzing CNN

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to detect brain tumors from MRI images. It classifies the tumor into four categories: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary**, and **No Tumor**. The model is trained using TensorFlow and deployed using a Flask web application.
